 # Heart Disease Prediction - Machine Learning Model

## 📌 Overview
This project is a **Heart Disease Prediction** system built using **Machine Learning** in Google Colab. The model predicts whether a person has heart disease based on medical attributes using **Logistic Regression**.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of medical dataset
- Training and testing using **Logistic Regression**
- Evaluation using **accuracy score**
- Lightweight and efficient model

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains the following medical attributes:
- **age**: Age of the person
- **sex**: Gender (0 = Female, 1 = Male)
- **cp**: Chest pain type
- **trestbps**: Resting blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **chol**: Serum cholesterol (mg/dL)
- **fbs**: Fasting blood sugar (> 120 mg/dL, 1 = True, 0 = False)
- **restecg**: Resting electrocardiographic results
- **thalach**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **exang**: Exercise-induced angina (1 = Yes, 0 = No)
- **oldpeak**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- **slope**: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- **ca**: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- **thal**: Thalassemia

The dataset can be obtained from publicly available sources such as Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.
 
## 📜 Libraries Used
The model is implemented using the following libraries:
- **numpy**: Numerical computations
- **pandas**: Data handling and manipulation
- **train_test_split**: Splitting dataset into training and testing sets
- **LogisticRegression**: Classification model
- **accuracy_score**: Evaluating model performance

## 📊 Model Performance
The model is evaluated using standard classification metrics such as:
- Accuracy:  0.819672131147541%
